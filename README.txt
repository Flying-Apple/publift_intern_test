## Questions

1. Create a GET path at `/hello` that returns "hello world".
2. Create a GET path at `/question2` that returns whatever value is passed for the query parameter `content`.
    1. E.g. If I make a request that looks like this `/question2?content=hello` , I want to see 'hello' in my return body.
3. Create a POST path at `/question3` which accepts **only** PNG or SVG files in the request, and store them in a temporary folder on your local machine.
    1. Hint: Use an application like Postman to make the request with the image.
